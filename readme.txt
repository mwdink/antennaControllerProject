This project is an exercise in using the Quantum Leaps QDK on an
Arduino platform. (That might be overkill but it was enlightening.)

The actual project is a controller for a mobile antenna. The 
antenna uses a motor to adjust a tap point on a coil for different
frequencies. There is a reed relay and a magnet on the motor shaft
for determining the motor/coil position.

The operator has access to switches for controlling the motor direct
and resetting the position counter. A display is provided for indicating
motor activity and position.
